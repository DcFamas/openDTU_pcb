# openDTU meets Sonoff

Because I had some Sonoff IP66 waterproofed housings laying around, I thought to create my first pcb in EasyEDA. So the *openDTU meets Sonoff* pcb come into being.

For the whole project you need:
- of the course the **ESP-WROOM-32** with openDTU installed
- **NRF24L01+** with or without the external antenna
- 0.96inch **SSD1306** OLED
- a **condensator up to 100uF** and something between 5V and 50V
- a terminal to connect the wires to, I used **KF120-2P**
- the pcb
- a Sonoff waterproofed housing
- a cable gland for the external antenna wider than the M12 standard one
- a 5V DC powersupply
- some cable

Here is my first attempt with a 3d printed layout. Because of the wiring, the cable gland won't fit for the antenna. Now I need to wait for the pcb to arrive. :)
